A better attempt at Apple's own Preview app

MacOS has some incredibly powerful and flexible APIs for viewing, printing and converting images to other formats. It's such a shame that Apple's own Preview application has been woeful in implementing them. This project hopes to improve on Preview in the following ways:

1. Loaded documents will not be re-saved without the user's express permission. By default, alteration suggests saving with a new name.

2. Improved Exporting of file types and modification of PDFs using Quartz Filters.

3. Improved AppleScript support.


Much of this is currently far beyond my abilities, so please feel free to contribute! The v.1.0 goal is to produce an app which loads images and PDFs for viewing and printing only.
